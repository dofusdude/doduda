Download the latest Dofus 3 version from Ankama and convert the interesting parts to a developer friendly format.

```bash
doduda && doduda map
```

## Features

See `doduda --help` for all parameters.

### Load

Download the latest Dofus version. You can change the target folder with `--output`.

You can also download the complete game to get a playable version without unpacking the files using `doduda --full`.
If you want a different platform version than Windows, you can specify the it with the `--platform` parameter.

### Map

Make the cryptic data easier to use in apps.

The command assumes that all categories (except images) are already downloaded.

### Watchdog

Listen for new Dofus versions and react to their release.

You can use that for getting anything that supports webhooks to react to Dofus version updates. Some ideas are:

- [Discord Channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
- [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) (Push notifications to your phone)

### Render

Generate pre-rendered, high resolution `.png` images from the vector files.

## Installation

`doduda` is a single binary that you can download and run. There are precompiled versions for Linux, macOS and Windows.

There is only one (optional) dependency: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

You need to have it installed when you:
- want to unpack the Dofus 3 data files.
- want to use the `render` command to generate images for Dofus 2.

You don't need it when you only want to use the `map` command or download the entire game (`--full`).

If you have problems with Docker, like a missing socket, the solution is often to your `docker.sock` path and link it to the missing path or export your path as `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable `export DOCKER_HOST=unix://<your docker.sock path>` before running `doduda`.

### Precompiled binaries (recommended)

Get the latest `doduda` binary from the [release](https://github.com/dofusdude/doduda/releases) page.

### Go install (needs [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) >= 1.21)

You need to have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH` for this to work, so `export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin` if you haven't already.

```bash
go install github.com/dofusdude/doduda@latest
```

### Build from source (needs [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) >= 1.21)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dofusdude/doduda
cd doduda
go build
```

## The dofusdude auto-update cycle

This tool is the first step in a pipeline that updates the data on [GitHub](https://github.com/dofusdude/dofus2-main) when a new Dofus version is released.

1. Two watchdogs (`doduda listen`) listen for new Dofus versions. One for main and one for beta. When something releases, the watchdog calls the GitHub API to start a workflow that uses `doduda` to download and parse the update to check for new elements and item_types. They hold global IDs for the API, so they must be consistent with each update.
2. At the end of the `doduda` workflow, it triggers the corresponding data repository to do a release, which then downloads the latest `doduda` binary (because it is a different workflow) and runs it to produce the final dataset. The data repository opens a release and uploads the files.
3. After a release, `doduapi` needs to know that a new update is available. The data repository workflow calls the update endpoint. The API then fetches the latest version from GitHub, indexes, starts the image upscaler (if necessary) and does a atomic switch of the database when ready.

## Known Problems

- Run `doduda` with `--headless` in a server environment or automations to avoid "no tty" errors.

## Credit

The code in the `unpack` directory is a port of the [PyDofus](https://github.com/balciseri/PyDofus) project to Go. Thanks to balciseri for the work on PyDofus!

The terminal visualizations are made with [vhs](https://vhs.charm.sh).

Many thanks to Ankama for developing and updating Dofus! All data belongs to them. I just make it more accessible for the developer community.
