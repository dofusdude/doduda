# doduda unpack

Dofus 2 unpacking is done natively in Go within this package.

For Dofus 3, we use Docker to run a modified version of [AssetStudio](https://github.com/aelurum/AssetStudio) for images and a C# containerized C# script for the binary i18n files and MonoBehaviours.

The MonoBehaviour unpacking project can be found in the `umbu` directory.
